# VALocker
API-Based Insta-lock tool for VALORANT
# How to use
**STARTUP** Simply run main.py (be sure to have required modules downloaded 
``pip install -r requirements.txt`` </br>
Run main.py, it will ask for the preferred agent, then have fun (it will be saved on config.json so that's where you change your preferred agent)
### Run VALORANT first, THEN the script </br>
**USEFUL**: This script is meant to be kept in the background. It will pause after every insta-lock, press F10 to unpause it</br>
**STOPPING**:  ctrl + shift + x or ctrl c to stop the script entirely (either works :v)
